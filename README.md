# Compiler-Design

This repository contains my codes for my compiler design course that I have taken at school.

I implemented a compiler similar to gcc or clang that translates C code all the way down to machine code which can be executed on the Intel IA-64 architecture.

All major steps of the translation process will be covered: scanning, syntax analysis, code generation and code optimization.

This compiler will be developed using LLVM, a very popular compiler infrastructure toolchain used by developers to create new programming languages or domain specific languages.
